# Tip Calculation & Distribution Logic

This rule summarizes the core logic for tip calculation, pooling, and distribution in the system. It is intended to help developers understand and navigate the main files and types involved in tipouts and payroll tip calculations.

## Main Implementation Files
- [reportCalculations.ts](mdc:src/utils/reportCalculations.ts): Implements the main daily tip pooling, distribution, and summary logic.
- [tipoutCalculations.ts](mdc:src/utils/tipoutCalculations.ts): Contains the core functions for calculating tipouts per shift and helpers for role config logic.
- [reports.ts](mdc:src/types/reports.ts): Defines the main types used throughout the tip logic, including `Shift`, `RoleConfig`, `EmployeeRoleSummary`, and `ReportSummary`.

## Core Logic Overview

### 1. Daily Presence Check
- For each day, determine if Host, SA, or Bar roles worked. This affects whether certain tipouts are paid.

### 2. Tip Pooling (`tipPoolGroup`)
- Shifts with the same non-null `tipPoolGroup` in their active `RoleConfig` are pooled together for that day.
- The pool's total original cash/credit tips and hours are summed.
- The pool's total tipouts for Host and SA are calculated and subtracted from the pool's total credit tips before distribution.
- **Bar tipout is NOT subtracted at the pool level.**

### 3. Distribution Pools
- For each tipout type (Bar, Host, SA), calculate the total amount paid into the pool by all shifts for the day.

### 4. Distribution Receiving
- For each shift, if its role config has `receivesTipout: true`, it receives a share of the corresponding distribution pool proportional to its hours within its `distributionGroup`.

### 5. Payroll Tips Calculation
- **Non-Pooled Roles:** Payroll tips = Original Credit Tips + Net Received Tipouts - Net Paid Tipouts.
- **Pooled Roles:** Payroll tips = Net pooled credit share + all received tipouts from distribution pools.

### 6. Final Summary
- Aggregates all processed shift data into `EmployeeRoleSummary` objects, including total hours, net tips, gross tips, tipouts, and payroll totals.

## Key Types & Fields
- `RoleConfig.tipPoolGroup`: Groups roles for pooling collected tips.
- `RoleConfig.distributionGroup`: Groups roles for receiving distributed tipouts.
- `RoleConfig.paysTipout`: Determines if a role contributes to a distribution pool.
- `RoleConfig.receivesTipout`: Determines if a role receives from a distribution pool.
- `EmployeeRoleSummary`: Stores all per-employee/role summary data for payroll and reporting.

# Tipout Calculation Logic

- **Tip Pooling:**
  - Shifts with the same non-null `tipPoolGroup` in their active `RoleConfig` are pooled together for that day.
  - The pool's total original cash/credit tips and hours are summed.
  - The pool's total tipouts for Host and SA are calculated and subtracted from the pool's total credit tips before distribution.
  - **Bar tipout is NOT subtracted at the pool level.**

- **Distribution:**
  - After Host and SA tipouts are deducted, the remaining pooled tips are distributed to individuals based on hours worked.

- **Bar Tipout:**
  - After tips are pooled and distributed, each individual pays their own bar tipout based on their own liquor sales and the bar tipout rate.
  - This means the bar tipout is calculated and deducted at the individual level, after pooling, not at the pool/group level.

- **Payroll Tips:**
  - For pooled roles: `payrollTips = net pooled credit share + received distribution tipouts - bar tipout paid by individual`
  - For non-pooled roles: `payrollTips = original credit tips + net tipouts received/paid`

- **Relevant Implementation:**
  - See [reportCalculations.ts](mdc:src/utils/reportCalculations.ts) for the main logic.
  - See [tipoutCalculations.ts](mdc:src/utils/tipoutCalculations.ts) for tipout calculation helpers.
  - See [reportCalculations.test.ts](mdc:src/utils/reportCalculations.test.ts) and [tipoutCalculations.test.ts](mdc:src/utils/tipoutCalculations.test.ts) for test cases verifying this behavior.
